# API Gateway Installation via Ansible

Instructions TODOs

## AWS S3 connectivity (optional)

The "installations" playbooks will pull file artifacts for you from AWS S3. 
If you want to test such automation features, you will need to have an AWS S3 environment available from the Ansible server.

Such artifacts to pull from S3 are:
 - SoftwareAG installer + SoftwareAG Update Manager (SUM) executables
 - Installer images + installer scripts
 - Fix images + sum scripts
